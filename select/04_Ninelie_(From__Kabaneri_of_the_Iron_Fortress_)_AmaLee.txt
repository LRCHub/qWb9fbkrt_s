Even if all the stars that hold our wishes could join as one

And unite against the odds
Every dream would still drown under the downpour
Their light left abandoned, falling victim to the storm

I have grown tired of...
Chasing this trail of vague replies
Eclipse of the rising sun
Our shattering dawn

At long last our daydream
Becomes a legend overturned
Though you shout and cry out
Our glory never will be heard
When not a single sound makes it through the darkness
We'll have the silence to carry the word
All we need is a single piece to match up
And fill the void in this puzzle left undone
It's a game, for here, all that bathes in triumph
Or that fails to conform, all is abandoned in the end
All thoughts that plague the mind
They live inside this box, confined
Awaiting one fateful day when they'll deceive us all

Don't be above your daydream
Never lose faith in your vision
Just believe in your dream
Even if it may lead you wrong
I'll sing my heart out to overcome the distance
A bridge of silence to carry our song

I'll only follow along to the beat and rhythm of my design
Leaving this city far behind
But at least I'll have you here by my side
Is this where we belong?
Or is this warped image just a sign
That we can't be awakened ...
So why put up resistance?

Can we only cry & dream
Fighting for our broken belief?
This city is happy to drown while never being heard
But I will fight these waves and this noise with my voice
Until the silence can carry the word

Don't be afraid, daybreak has come
Don't be afraid, daybreak has come
Don't be afraid, daybreak has come
Don't be afraid, daybreak has come
